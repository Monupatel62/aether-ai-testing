# Repository specification: aether-ai-testing

**Status:** Documentation baseline copied from the Aether AI master specification. Implementation status must be verified separately.

## Mission

Shared fixtures, contract/integration/smoke tests, CI quality gates, and test-environment conventions.

## Dependencies and connections

All repositories and CI pipelines.

## Owned capabilities

Synthetic fixtures, consumer/provider contracts, test pyramid, flaky-test policy, test secrets policy, failure injection.

## Non-goals

- Duplicating domain logic owned by another repository.
- Storing secrets in source control or logging raw sensitive payloads.
- Bypassing authentication, tenant authorization, retention, or audit requirements.
- Treating a repository boundary as automatic proof that a separate runtime service is required.

## Contract requirements

- Version public schemas and message envelopes.
- Document limits, timeouts, retry behavior, idempotency, cancellation, and error handling where relevant.
- Preserve correlation IDs across API, agent, tool, queue, and provider operations.
- Document operational signals and failure recovery, not only the happy path.

## Security and reliability checklist

- [ ] Least privilege and tenant isolation.
- [ ] Safe configuration defaults and runtime-only secrets.
- [ ] Input validation and payload limits.
- [ ] Retry-safe behavior and duplicate-delivery handling.
- [ ] Data retention/deletion and log redaction.
- [ ] Backup/restore or rollback plan where state/configuration is involved.

## Implementation gates

1. Confirm ownership and dependencies in [master catalog](https://github.com/Monupatel62/aether-ai-platform/blob/main/docs/REPOSITORY_CATALOG.md).
2. Decide open infrastructure choices through ADRs rather than assumptions.
3. Build a minimal, testable component and add contract tests.
4. Run dependency/license, vulnerability, secret, and configuration checks.
5. Update architecture and runbooks in the same change as behavior.

All external projects are references or candidate dependencies only. Verify exact version, license, dependency tree, and security posture before reuse.

## Security and privacy

Test harnesses must not use production credentials or real customer data by default. Protect secrets in CI, isolate destructive/integration tests, sanitize artifacts, and ensure adversarial fixtures are synthetic. Avoid tests that accidentally call real tools or send external messages.

## Test plan

Test secret scanning and synthetic-data enforcement; verify fixtures are deterministic, cleanup runs after failure, external calls are mocked by default, and CI permissions are least-privilege.

Before release, add unit tests, contract tests for direct dependencies, negative authorization/input tests, and failure/recovery tests for the behavior this component owns. Use synthetic or sanitized data only.
